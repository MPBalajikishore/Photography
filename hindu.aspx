        Hindu wedding, a celebration of love where tradition meets elegance and the souls are ignited with the blessings of gods and ancestors. 
        With colours and rituals this vibrant occasion is infused with the legendary stories of Ram-Sita and Radha-Krishna. 
        These valuable moments are meant to be preserved.
